Project components for use cases:
1) Children:
- virtual fences
- detect proximity relative to object such as bicycle
 - dynamic virtual fence
- wristband/keychain/hide somewhere
 - designer holder
 - prevent band from being taken off?
- virtual path
 - children going to school
 - checkpoint
- abnormal speeds?
 - in case child gets in unknown car?

2) Elderly people -- OUT OF SCOPE --
 - targeting mainly elderly people with Alzheimers
 - Virtual fences
 - Detection of falls
 - Button for calling assistance?
 
Priorities: 1-5, 

Use cases:
1) Child plays in the backyard and wanders off
Actors: child, parent

 - Position of the child is updated until child is in safe-zone
 
2) Child going to school

4) Device is attached to an object (bicycle)
Actors: bicycle, child
 - Owner is informed if bike virtual fence
   - OR owner is informed if bike leaves child's proximity

5) Removing wristband
Actor: child
 - Parent is detected
 
6) Defining a virtual fence, inside which the kid is allowed to be
Actor: parent
 a) GPS coordinates & radius or RPi console
 b) Send coordinates from PC to PI
 c) Web-interface
 d) App
- 

7) Defining a safe zone
Actor: parent
- Same as 6, just labelled different type

8) Defining times when it is ok to leave one zone (leaving for school/leaving school)
Actor: parent
- Inputting zone involved
- Inputting start and/or stop times

9) Defining an allowed time for the way to the second virtual fence
Actor: parent
- Inputting zone involved
- Inputting start and/or stop times

10) Specifying phone numbers for notifications
Actor: parent
- Enters number

11) Specifying what the device is used for
Actor: Parent
- Setting in the interface whether the device is used on the bicycle or child

Changes for next prototype: 
- pop-up for information about buildings should still allow all other interactions (no need to click it away first)
- add more information about a building (trivia, toilets?)
- add swipe and click option in "Offers" to navigate from one offer to another
- remove menu button (is not needed, could be hidden in the profile)
  frees up space for top buttons
- add hints when in scan mode / ar mode ("ready to scan tag" / "click to activate")
- add hint to riddle ("scroll down to get a hint", "scroll up to hide")
- add promt "are you sure you want to use a hint"
  --> AR really necessary? nice gimmick, but not specifically needed, scanning a code seems to be enough.
- add explations to badges (show them as pop-ups when clicking on them, display name, e.g. "discovered 5 cafes")
- add "selected" indication for buttom buttons
- add hint to "wrong" solution: "you get more points if you find this place with a riddle"
- if no riddle is selected, add "click to get your first riddle"

Prio 2:
- add ability to see friends profile
- show riddle if the place is claimed without a riddle "just for fun"
- show solved riddles in the map screen when clicking on the stars
